# Rice Yield Estimation Using UAV and Machine Learning

This repository contains Python code for rice yield prediction using UAV-derived vegetation indices and machine learning models, which are Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)

## Models Implemented are
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network
- Linear Regression
- BMA Full (all models)
- BMA Reduced (nonlinear ML models only)

## Contents
- `RP_ML_V21.py` – Main modeling and evaluation pipeline

## Data
Raw uav data (like UAV images) is not included, only the derived features and processed datasets are used for modeling.
